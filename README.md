# What is this?
This is an unofficial fork from [PDFGrabber](https://github.com/FelixFrog/pdfgrabber), a vendor-agnostic script is used to download pdfs (and covers) from different services.

# Disclaimer
This script is provided "as is", without any type of warranty. I am not responsible of any harm that this may cause.
Even though this script exists, you are responsibile of the PDFs generated. Check if the backup of books is legal in your country.
